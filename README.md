# React Exercise

The exercise code can be found on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-exercise-start-pnkue).

## Todo

### Step 1 - Cleanup

_Goal: Learn how to think in component based user interfaces and how React components are rendered._

- [ ] ♻️ Cleanup the application by splitting App.js into reusable, small components
- [ ] ♻️ Refactor app.css to smaller CSS files, co-located with the relevant component. Tip: Use [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for better isolation of your components.

### Step 2 - Make it work

_Goal: Learn how we can use React Hooks and EcmaScript to make applications do more than just display data._

- [ ] 🚸 Display the actual genre name in stead of the genre id
- [ ] ✨ Clicking the "+"-icon on a post should add the movie to the watchlist
- [ ] ✨ Save the watchlist in localStorage, load it back from localStorage when visiting the app
- [ ] ✨ Selecting a "Sort by" option should sort the watchlist
- [ ] ✨ The "Genres" filter should display all genres found in the watchlist
- [ ] ✨ Clicking a genre in "Genres" should filter the watchlist, so only movies with the selected genre are displayed
- [ ] 💅 Format the date to e.g. 19 sep 2019

### Step 3 - Make it dynamic

_Goal: Real applications often work with remote data. Learn how we can fetch data in React_

- [ ] 🔑 Create an account at [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), and obtain your API key in [your profile settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
- [ ] 📝 API documentation can be found [here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)
